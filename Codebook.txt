Project Description

The project uses the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung
Galaxy S Smartphone. The project combines the test and train datasets and 
selects those variables that are capturing a mean or a standard deviation, 
and then for each user and each activity summarizes the mean of those 
selected variables in a tidy dataset named "tidy_group_means.txt"


Collection of the raw data

The raw data was downloaded from the following link on 7/24/2015

The reference for the data is:

Notes on the raw data

See the accompanying README.md file


Creating the tidy data file

1) Download the data
2) Combine subjects and activities data with measurement data
3) Combine train and test data
4) Select only columns that contain measurements of mean or standard deviation
5) Rename variables
6) Take the mean for each group of measurments for each subject/activity pair
7) Output the tidy data into a .txt file


Cleaning the data

The accompanying script downloads, unzips, and reads in the data collected
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The script 
matches the subjects (1 through 30) with the activities (e.g, walking, 
sitting, etc.), for both the test and train datasets, and combines these 
into a dataset called, fulldata. The script then selects only variables 
that include either the a mean or standard deviation measurement and 
creates a subset called, data_mean_std (dim=1099 x 88). 
The variables in this dataset are then renamed to follow a 
more meaningful pattern. The script then groups by subject and
activity and generates the mean value of each measurement for each
subject-activity pairing in a dataset called, tidy_group_means.

Variables

subject (class: integer)
Subject are numbered one through thirty. Each subject performed all six activities and had multiple 
readings for each of the measurements.

activity (class: factor)
The six factor levels for the activity variable are: walk, walk_up, walk_down, lay, sit, stand
and represent different activities that were performed while the various measurements were taken.

Commonalities and components of all other variables
1) class: numeric
2) represent a mean statistic over the multiple readings for each subject/activity pair, and 
therefore begin with the the letters "group"
3) if the original measurement was a mean statistic, then the variable name begins with 
"groupmean"
4) if the original measurement was a standard deviation statistice, then the variable name
begins with "groupstd"
5) for "groupmean" and "groupstd" varialbes that are measurements along the X, Y, or Z axis,
an X, Y, or Z will follow the "groupmean" or "groupstd" portion of the varialbe anme as in,
"groupmeanX" or "groupstdY"
6) if the original measurement was a mean of a frequency statistic, then the variable name
begins with "groupmeanf", with the f denoting frequency
7) Gyroscope and Accelerator have been written out in the varialbe names in the 
tidy_group_means.txt dataset for clarity
8) group variables that represent the angle between vectors begin with "groupangle"
9) the acceleration signal is separated into "Body" and "Gravity"
10) "tBody" or "tGravity" in the variable name indicates that these are time domain 
signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
11) "fBody" or "fGravity" in the varialbe name indicates these measurments are
for frequency domain signals.
12) Variables including "Jerk" in the variable name were derived from 
the body linear acceleration and angular velocity.
13) A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 


Variable names based on the commonalities and components:
groupmeanX_tBodyAccelerometer is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each

of the time signal for Body of the Accelerometer.
groupmeanY_tBodyAccelerometer is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the Y-axis
of the time signal for Body of the Accelerometer.
groupmeanZ_tBodyAccelerometer is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the Z-axis
of the time signal for Body of the Accelerometer.
groupmeanX_tGravityAccelerometer is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the X-axis
of the time signal for Gravity of the Accelerometer.
groupmeanY_tGravityAccelerometer is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the X-axis
of the time signal for Gravity of the Accelerometer.
groupmeanZ_tGravityAccelerometer is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the X-axis
of the time signal for Gravity of the Accelerometer.
groupmeanX_tBodyAccelerometerJerk is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the X-axis
of the time signal for Body of the Accelerometer applying the Fast Fourier Transform.
groupmeanY_tBodyAccelerometerJerk is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the Y-axis
of the time signal for Body of the Accelerometer applying the Fast Fourier Transform.
groupmeanZ_tBodyAccelerometerJerk is the overall mean of the multiple readings for each
subject/activity pair of the variable that measures the mean reading of the Z-axis
of the time signal for Body of the Accelerometer applying the Fast Fourier Transform.

The remaining variables are similarly constructed by combining the components described above.
